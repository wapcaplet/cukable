Cukable
=======

Cukable allows you to write and execute [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) tests
from [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org).

It consists of a [rubyslim](http://github.com/unclebob/rubyslim) fixture that
invokes Cucumber, and a custom Cucumber output formatter that returns
SliM-formatted test results to FitNesse.
