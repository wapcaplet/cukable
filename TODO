TODO in order to distribute this puppy standalone:

- Write spec tests for Cuke fixture and SlimJSON formatter
- Allow Cuke fixture to be called Cucumber again
- Create a Rails generator of some kind for:
    - Cuke fixture
    - SlimJSON formatter
    - Example FitNesse wiki pages

Would it work (from rubyslim's perspective) to directly import the fixture
without it being inside the FitNesse / Rails app's directory? Possibly via:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'cukeness'
